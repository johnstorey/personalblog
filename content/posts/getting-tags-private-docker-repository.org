Tip of the day, cribbed from [[https://gist.github.com/kizbitz/e59f95f7557b4bbb8bf2][this gist]]. This allows you to get the image tags on an image in a private Docker Hub repository. First setup the environment variables.

These instructions assume that you have the great tool, [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] installed. If you don't, why not? 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
UNAME=yourusername
UPASS=yourpassword
ORG=yourorganization # Might be the same as your username; mine is for the company.
#+END_SRC

Now get an authorization token.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username": "'${UNAME}'", "password": "'${UPASS}'"}' https://hub.docker.com/v2/users/login/ | jq -r .token)
#+END_SRC

From there you can list the repositories. I'll assign them to a variable as well.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
REPO_LIST=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: JWT ${TOKEN}" https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/${UNAME}/?page_size=100 | jq -r '.results|.[]|.name')
#+END_SRC

For a particular repository, REPOSITORY, you can get it's tags in order from most recent to least, with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
IMAGE_TAGS=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: JWT ${TOKEN}" https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/$ORG/$REPOSITORY/tags/?page_size=100 | jq -r '.results|.[]|.name')

#+END_SRC
