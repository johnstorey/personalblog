# Where I Am Coming From

I'm a classic Silicon Valley type -- the stereotype that is common, but not as common as people seem to think. Christian, white, male, older.

- the have-nots always want more; the haves always resent giving from their excess.
- political systems world-wide are run by normal humans, who at the end of the day, are for sale. So laws tend to favor the haves.


So what will be the ultimate end of basic income? I suspect it will be used to control an underclass via a form of hydraulic despotism. Laws will be passed and judgements handed down to enforce the status quo.

# Survival Is Not Enough

One of my very strong suspicions is that many of society's problems stem from the lack of hope and opportunity that already permeates the world when you don't have enough. The stack is literally against you. Try to raise kids as a waitress today, and compare that to the life of a child born in Palo Alto. Those two children are put on the road to a ruling class and underclass before they are born, and
